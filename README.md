Intro
===============================================================================
Math Canvas is a project done for Carnegie Mellon's 15-237 Cross-Platform Mobile
Web Apps class. You can find the course webpage at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~237/

Because this is a cross-platform mobile web app it works both on iOS and Android
devices, and theoretically, any semi-modern browser.

Math Canvas uses a Typescript Framework developed for general purpose mobile
applications (https://github.com/jlreyes/ts-mobile-framework).

Running
================================================================================
1. Run a redis server (http://redis.io/)
2. node webserver.js
3. node socketserver.js

Building
================================================================================
There are build.sh files scatterred throughout the project. They build various
things depending on the folder they are in.

Project Layout

Note about the project layout:
Throughout the project you will see "mobile" within filenames. This is because
I have built the project so that it should be easy to expand to desktop or
tablet if I ever have the desire. Mostly everything is done with a MVC or MV
structure so that I simply have to create a implement a new view (or in many
cases, simply implement a new template) in order for the app to work on said
device.
