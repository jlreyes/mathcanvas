Note about the project layout:
Throughout the project you will see "mobile" within filenames. This is because
I have built the project so that it should be easy to expand to desktop or
tablet if I ever have the desire. Mostly everything is done with a MVC or MV
structure so that I simply have to create a implement a new view (or in many
cases, simply implement a new template) in order for the app to work on said
device.


/*****************************************************************************/
/* REQUIRED ELEMENTS                                                         */
/*****************************************************************************/
The required elements are in the order they appear on the webpage. I've marked
the ten to be graded with a "G"

1. Javascript - G
    -Heavy javascript usage on both the server and a small amount of usage on
     the client side.
    -Although typescript is used on the client side, typescript isn't very far
     from javascript.
2. Canvas - G
    -A drawing module is simply a canvas that can be drawn on. I use individual
     canvases for each drawing to prevent unecessary redraws.
3. HTML - G
    -Although index.html is small, my application framework uses "pages". Each
     page has its own HTML template that is dynamically loaded when you change
     to said page.
    -To dynamically load pages, I use the the templating libary "dust"
     (https://github.com/linkedin/dustjs). Dust is very similar to mustache,
     except it that is compiled to javascript for fast rendering and that
     it is asynchronous (or at least, it is intended to be).
    -When loading a page, my application framework "inflates" its template and
     then uses jquery to parse the template and "mobilize" it. That is, we look
     for buttons and other elements with data-type=button as an attribute and
     then we add ontap listeners using the ontap library (written for jelp and
     edited by me) in order to get better mobile feedback. We do other parsing
     during the inflation as well.
4. CSS - G
    -I use a CSS normalizer, not a reset. Simply because I just wanted
     normalized css across browsers, not necessarily reset css that is helpful
    -Beyond the normalizer, I use no libraries. All CSS was done by me.
    -I use SCSS to compile css. I use a mixin to patch prefixed properties as
     well as a mixin for gradients.
    -I use css transitions throughout my application. I have a transition class
     that I apply to pages when I want them to transition, otherwise they do
     not have that class. PageTransitioner.ts contains the page transition code.
     I have a function that waits for a css transition to finish and then calls
     a callback.
    -Pages are contained within a page container and these page containers are
     moved around to simulate transitionining forward, back, and by fading.
    -There is obviously heavy css being done in the "canvas". Within
     whiteboardmoduleview.ts and each modules individual view, all effects are
     done with css.
    -On the room page, we make use of the css class I made called "tab". A tab
     is expected to contain elements that overflow horizontally. If the
     the elements overflow horizontally, a horizontal scrollbar appears so you
     can view the elements on desktop. On moble, no scrollbar appears but you
     swipe to reveal hidden elements. This class allows me to make UIs that
     have an unlimited number of horizontal buttons, mitigating the problem of
     screen size.
5. DOM manipulation
    -I use jquery for dom manipulation. My application framework does a lot
     of dom manipulation that I have already stated. For example:
        -Pages are injected dynamically
        -Pages are moved around with css
    -My application framework also keeps the last visited page in the dom.
     So if the user clicks back, we don't need to reload the template.
    -The "canvas" in the room page is actually just a div containing all the
     canvas modules which themselves are some html element.
6. jQuery - G
    -Again, I use jquery everywhere. Beyond dom manipulation and selection,
     I use its static methods such as $.post, $.getJSON, etc.
    -I also use a jquery declarations file for typescript
7. jQuery Mobile/Sencha Touch/equivalent - G
    -As stated, I made my own application framework. 
8. PhoneGap
    -It's packaged via phonegap.
9. AJAX client - G
    -Everything is done with AJAX client side. I use the AJAX API described
     below.
    -I use Util.postJSON for json requests. This wrapper checks the result
     for errors and displays the error if one exists.
10. AJAX server - G
    -I created an AJAX api that can be accessed with post requests to
     /json/<module>/<command>. The result of all calls is a json object
     using the JsonResponse class I created. On success, each command
     defines its own output. On error, however, the resulting JSON
     object contains an "error" key with a value being the error message.
    -Commands and modules can be found in /lib/commands
11. node.js with express
    -I use express (and node, obviously) to serve files to users.
    -I manage login with passport and encrypt passwords and ids with crypto
    -I have an AJAX api as stated above
12. websockets - G
    -I use websockets (i.e. socket.io) and a socket server to send data
     between users.
    -I segregrate users into rooms and only exchange data between users
     in the same room.
    -Socket.ts manages messages, message queuing (making sure to queue
     messages if no one can receive a message so we don't lose them),
     error handling, etc.
    -socketserver.js manages the sockets.
13. localStorage
    -I use local storage to store canvas states and give users to reload the
     states at a later time
14. server-side databases - G
    -I use redis to manage both users and rooms.
    -A description of the database structure is in DbClient.js
    -Redis wrappers can be found in DbClient.js
    -Because redis is in-memory, I can read and store in the database before
     routing a socket message. As seen in socketserver.js, I take advantage
     of this.
    -Because redis is in-memory, if my server dies there is a potential for
     a loss of data. However, this is a trade-off I must make due to the
     need for fast read and writes. Redis does store the database to disk
     every 5 minutes or 100 writes, though. So I won't lose too much data.
15. Typescript - G 
    -I use typescript for everything client-side (I should have used it for
     server side, but I didn't).

|----------------|
SUGGESTION:
The "chat" icon was a person, I should make this a speech bubble

RESULT: Done
|----------------|
SUGGESTION:
The chat should display some notification when a message is received

RESULT: Implemented internally, but I need to wait for icons to finish this.
|----------------|
SUGGESTION:
The default way to register is confusing because, unlike other registration
forms on the web, the login and registration forms are not separate.

RESULT:
I need to provide hints on the login screen to combat the confusion. Also,
the error message provided when you click register without filling in the
form is not very helpful. Fixing this should fix that.
|----------------|
SUGGESTION:
When you edit a module, intuitivly you want to be able to move it. Clicking
a button to move isn't intuitive.

RESULT: Have to change some code around for this, but will do this next week.
|----------------|
SUGGESTION:
When someone else is editing a module, highlight the module so a user knows
what is being edited.

RESULT: This is a good idea, but requires a bit of server reworking, so I'll do
this.

/* ITERATIVE DESIGN/STORYBOARDS                                              */
/*****************************************************************************/
Examples of iterative design are available in /mockups/balsamiq.
There are xml files there that contain balsamiq mockups you can load on
balsamiq.
My competitive analysis is there as well.

As you can see by my mockups, I was overly ambitious and thus my design ended
up becoming drastically simplified. For example, I switched to an entirely
mobile interface. This mobile interface is very similar to my semi-final
interface, however.

Examples of my design changing:
1. I am adding icons in response to user testing
2. I am adding more onscreen hints in response to user testing
3. I changed the header and footer buttons in response to user testing.
